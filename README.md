# 'this' Keyword Workshop

This is a repository to test your understanding of the keyword 'this' in JavaScript. 

# Pointers
What determines the value of 'this'?
- determined by how a function is called
- can't be set by assignment during execution

Main patterns:
- global reference (this usually refers to global object)
- free function invocation (global object)
- call/apply (first argument to call/apply)
- method invocation (object on the left of dot, at call time)
- construction mode (new object created for that invocation)

# How to use repo:

1. Fork this repo and clone to your local machine
2. Open `this.js`. DO NOT OPEN `thisSpec.js` YET.
3. Code your solutions to the problems based on the prompts
4. Review your solutions and once you're satisfied, open up `SpecRunner.html` to check your results.
5. Learn from your results and revisit workshop as necessary.
